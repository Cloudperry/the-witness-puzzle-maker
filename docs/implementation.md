# Structure of the program
- The project consists of one program for playing the game and many programs that generate levels
  - gameUi.nim
    - The game ui/application. Opens levels that are generated by the programs mentioned below.
  - levels/*.nim
    - Programs that generate level files as a binary representation of Nim types (using [Frosty](https://github.com/disruptek/frosty))
- The programs use these libraries
  - graphs.nim
    - Implements a generic graph data structure using adjacency lists.  
  - geometry.nim
    - Implements vectors, vector operations and some geometry and math functions
  - levels.nim 
    - Implements the level format (data structure) and saving/loading the levels to/from the disk. Also includes functions for making levels that are used by level generating programs.
  - game.nim
    - Implements the game logic and the level solution checking algorithm
  - levelGfx.nim
    - Implements a coordinate transformation from the level coordinates (floats) to pixel coordinates for drawing (integers). Handles drawing the levels.
