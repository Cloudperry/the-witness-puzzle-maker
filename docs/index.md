# Test coverage
Test coverage was generated by [Coco](https://github.com/binhonglee/coco). The coverage document can be found [here](coverage/index.html).

# Implementation document
I will make the implementation document using Nim's documentation generator and link it here. Nim's documentation generator has the benefit of being able to mention functions and variables in docs and have them link to
source. It also supports Nim code snippets and can show function signatures as part of the docs.

# Source code documentation
Source code documentation generated by the Nim compiler from doc comments can be found [here](generated/theindex.html).
